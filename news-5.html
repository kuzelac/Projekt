			<h2>German tourist, 20, dies from box jellyfish</h2>
			<p class="description">A 20-year-old German woman has died after being stung multiple times by a box jellyfish at a tourist-popular Thai resort.</p>
			<p>The woman was taking an evening swim on Tuesday on the island of Koh Samui when she was stung by the jellyfish, whose venom can kill an adult within minutes.</p>
			<p>A friend of the woman, also a German tourist, was stung on the hand by a jellyfish but survived.</p>
			<p>The Bangkok Post reports that the woman, who it named as Thies Saskia, 'became entangled in the long poisonous tentacles of a box jellyfish at Lamai beach in Tambon Mared.'</p>
			<p>It is the third reported fatality in Thailand in the past 14 months from the world's most toxic jellyfish.</p>
			<p>The other two recent deaths from box jellyfish occurred at another popular Thai island, Koh Phangan, known for the infamous Full Moon Party. </p>
			<p>A Thai woman died there after being stung in August, while a five-year-old French boy died from a sting in August 2014.</p>
			<p>Police on Koh Samui met with business owners and municipal officials today (Wednesday) to discuss how to prevent future casualties from box jellyfish, which are not common to most parts of Thailand.</p>
			<p>Business owners are afraid that putting up warning signs would reduce the number of tourists, but we explained the necessity of this practice,' Police Lt. Col Thewet Pruemsut said."</p>
