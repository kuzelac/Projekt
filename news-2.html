			<h2>Are swarms of jellyfish taking over the ocean?</h2>
			<p class="description">For years we have been told that jellyfish are growing in numbers and will swarm the oceans. But this may not be true.</p>
			<p>For the last decade there have been regular reports of jellyfish invading beaches across the world. These "jellyfish blooms" have also caused serious problems for power stations.</p>
			<p>What's more, many scientists have claimed that jellyfish populations are increasing worldwide. Their studies have triggered alarming headlines like "Jellyfish taking over ocean, experts warn" and "What you need to know about the coming jellyfish apocalypse".</p>
			<p>Anyone who has seen a jellyfish bloom for themselves might find this plausible. There are certainly local and regional explosions in jellyfish populations.</p>
			<p>However, the idea that jellyfish are taking over the oceans seems to be built on wobbly foundations. A recent study has found evidence that poor scholarship has led to the evidence behind such a claim being hugely inflated.</p>
			<p>Jellyfish populations are believed to rise and fall over several decades. In certain areas, jellyfish populations do go through dramatic increases, leading to periods where there seem to be more jellyfish than usual in a given spot.</p>
			<p>Jellyfish also often move in large groups known as "fluthers" or "smacks". These can certainly seem overwhelming.</p>
			<p>But are the oceans as a whole becoming steadily jellified? Marina Sanz-Martín at the Mediterranean Institute for Advanced Studies in Spain and her colleagues investigated how scientists have gone about answering this question.</p>
			<p>BSanz-Martín started investigating the literature on jellyfish blooms in 2012. She picked the issue because she had heard about the widely-reported problem of the jellification of the oceans.</p>
